Welcome, mortal. You have stumbled into the sacred halls of the Meme Generator — an app forged 
in the fires of procrastination and tempered with caffeine. 

If you came here to make memes, congratulations: you’re exactly where destiny (and very bad decisions) wants you.

## Features
- Meme Gallery: A buffet of templates for your inspiration.
- Meme Editor: Add text onto images, pick fonts, colors, alignments, and drag text.
- Save Memes: Keep your masterpieces to admire or regret later.
- Download Memes: Export as images so you can spam them across the internet.
- Share Memes: One-click share to Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram, Gmail — because virtue signaling is easier with pictures.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, phone, carrier pigeon (not really).

## How to conjure a meme
1. **Open** index.html in your browser..
2. **Browse** the Meme Gallery and choose your template.
3. **Edit it**:
   - Add text (top, bottom, or whatever).
   - Change font size, color, alignment, and style (bold, italic, or absurdly dramatic).

4. **Save or Download**: Keep it in the app or export to your device.
5. **Share**: Unleash chaos on social platforms.
